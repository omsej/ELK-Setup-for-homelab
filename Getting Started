After seting up the free account, follow the prompts to deploy.

**Watch out! The initial login credentials will be displayed during deployment!! Take note**

Once the deployment is complete you will see a welcome page. 
Feel free to browse but when ready, go to fleet by clickick the tri-bar button at the top left, scroll all the way down to "Management" and select "Fleet".

In fleet, select "Add agent" towards the upper right side of the screen.

In the popup window, you will see several options to name your agent policy and tags. We're just going to keep defaults in this excersize but if you are intending on using this lab for an extended period then I recomend you come up with a naming convention starting with the first policy.
